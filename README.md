# Basis of the model - Thermodynamic Equilibrium in Conducting Materials
The main principle of this model is to examine the processes involved in reaching thermodynamic equilibrium in a conducting material, and to output the       equilibrium temperature. This model is based on a material experiencing heating at one end, and follows the flow of heat throughout the material. The code takes an imput which will be the number of segments in which the material is examined for temperature. The purpose of segmenting the material is to observe the behaviour of the the heat transfer over time in specific regions. The final output will be the temperature of the material once thermal equilibrium has been reached. 
# Assumptions of the model
There are a number of asumptions made when modeling this process, the first of which is to assume there is perfect contact with the heat supply, whether this be another material or otherwise. It is also assumed that there is no heat or work transfer between the environment and the conducting body. 
The model will initially be examined on a macroscopic level, for this the _First Law of Thermodynamics_ will be implemented: **ΔU = Q – W** 
It will be assumed that the work done in the system is zero, therefore the equation will become: **ΔU = Q**
